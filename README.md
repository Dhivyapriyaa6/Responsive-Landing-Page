# Responsive Landing Page 

##  Project Overview
This project is a **Responsive Landing Page** with an **interactive navigation menu**.  
The navigation bar changes its **color/style on scroll** and **menu item hover**, and it stays **fixed at the top**, making it visible on all pages.

This task focuses on improving **UI/UX**, **responsiveness**, and **basic JavaScript interactivity**.
